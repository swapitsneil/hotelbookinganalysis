üìã Project Overview

Dataset: A hotel booking dataset with fields like booking ID, hotel type (resort or city), arrival date, room type, meal plan, booking channel, cancellation status, and pricing.
Tools: Visualizations were created using Microsoft Excel.
Objective: To analyze hotel booking data and present findings through visuals that address specific problem statements.

‚ùì Problem Statements
The following problem statements are addressed in this project, with corresponding visualizations:

1. What are the booking trends over time?  

Analyze the number of bookings per month or year to identify seasonal patterns.  
Visual: Line chart showing monthly booking trends from 2015 to 2017.  
Insight: Helps in understanding peak booking periods for better resource planning.


2. What is the cancellation rate, and how does it vary by hotel type and booking channel?

Visual: Bar chart comparing cancellation rates across different categories.  
Insight: Identifies factors contributing to cancellations, such as booking channel or hotel type.


3. How is revenue distributed across hotel types, and what is the average daily rate (ADR) by room type?  

Compute total revenue for resort and city hotels and calculate ADR for different room types.  
Visual: Pie chart for revenue distribution; bar chart for ADR by room type.  
Insight: Highlights which hotel type or room type generates the most revenue.

Insight: Reveals high-demand room types for inventory management.


6. How does lead time affect cancellations?  

Study the distribution of lead times and their relationship with cancellation rates.  
Visual: Histogram of lead times with a trendline for cancellation rates.  
Insight: Shows if longer lead times correlate with higher cancellations.
